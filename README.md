# 03 Humane Password Generator

# Description

This web page takes in the user requirements of password length and character types required to create a valid password.  In doing so, we can pratice a new key techiques in Javascript.  Firstly, I pratice how to take in user input either through a prompt and open dialog box or through confirmation and rejection alert boxes.  I also pratice how to sanitize user inputs.  This webpage fails to create a password if it isn't given a valid length and if there is no character from which to select from.  I have written code to bounds the type of inputs that the user can give our javascript and reprompts the user for another input if the input should fail.  Data sanitization is very important for many user applications and pratice on this techique is always useful.  

I created this project as a way to tackle the simple loop of user input to output.  Password creation is universally useful, relatively annoying to create well by hand, and easy to display.  all these attributes make it the perfect project to use to pratice javascript with a simple front end.

This project was interesting, learning how the different prompts, alerts and confirms interact with the user helps transfer my knowledge from python to javascript, and adjusting myself to the javascript syntax. In addition, when using the program in google chrome versus firefox, it is interesting how prompt and alert work
